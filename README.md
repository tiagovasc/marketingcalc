# Ad Platform Cost-Effectiveness Calculator

## Project Overview

This project provides a tool to compare the cost-effectiveness of two digital advertising platforms: **Blaze** and **Addressable**. While both platforms offer audience targeting and segmentation, Addressable uniquely features a machine learning algorithm for conversion optimization. However, Addressable's advanced capabilities come with a higher cost. This tool aims to analyze the effectiveness threshold at which Addressable's conversion optimization justifies its higher price, aiding in the decision-making process for selecting an ad platform.

## Features

The HTML-based calculator embedded with JavaScript performs the following functions:

1. **True Cost Per Click (CPC) Calculation**: Computes the True CPC for Blaze and Addressable based on user inputs.
2. **Effectiveness Ratio Calculation**: Compares the cost-effectiveness of Addressable against Blaze.
3. **Required Optimization for Addressable**: Determines the necessary level of audience optimization for Addressable to achieve cost-effectiveness equivalent to or better than Blaze at various budget levels ($3,000, $10,000, and $100,000).

## How to Use

1. **Input Parameters**: Enter subscription fees, ad spend, ad spend fee percentage, baseline CPC, and audience optimization percentage for Addressable.
2. **Calculate Results**: Click "Calculate" to see the True CPC for both platforms, the Effectiveness Ratio, and Addressable's required optimization levels for different budgets.
3. **Analyze and Experiment**: Use the results to understand Addressable's cost-effectiveness. Adjust inputs to simulate different scenarios and further analyze the trade-offs.
